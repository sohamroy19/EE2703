### Week 01
- Problem statement: At the end of [`Assignment 1.pdf`](Assignment 1.pdf)
- Example `.netlist` files: In [`example_netlists`](example_netlists) folder
- Sample code: [`assign1_sample.py`](assign1_sample.py)
- My solution: [`spice_1.py`](spice_1.py)

### Week 02
- Problem statement: At the end of [`Assignment 2.pdf`](Assignment 2.pdf)
- Custom `.netlist` files: In [`custom_netlists`](custom_netlists) folder
- My solution: [`spice_2.py`](spice_2.py)

[`test.sh`](test.sh) is a script to run the python scripts on all netlists.
